				Disappointed. I still have a bitter taste in my mouth as I am writing these words. With high hopes in search for a cuppa awesome coffee my partner in crime and I ventured to `Man vs Machine’. First impression as we stepped in the door - great place: golden gadgetry, aeropresses, self-designed wallpaper, hanging lights and hipster all-around. Then we each ordered a flat white - my default and fav in one. As we held the cups in our hands the bubbles apparent on the crema already were the first hint that the milk had gotten too hot in the process. The latte art however was quite acceptable. Then the first sip - and oh, what disappointment. It. was. bitter. Especially if your espresso machine displays a sign “life can be bitter. your coffee shouldn’t be.” that’s an absolute no-go. Of course our cups could have been outliers, but consistently delivered good coffee is what defines a kick ass cafe. On a different note, the beetroot brownie we ordered along with the coffee was quite something. Soft, juicy, chocolaty with a subtle note of beetroot. Awesome. Well, I will be back to give this place another shot since it was obvious they took pride in what they did. I hope to have more positive things to share next time around.
